3. Follow the steps, which prompt you to give your shop a name and set a email address to receive order confirmations. <br /><br />Outgoing mails send to your customers use per default the unchained mail server and look like this <u>_noreply@unchained.shop_</u> .<br />However, there is the option to configure **Advanced email settings** which allow you to set your shop's sender email address using your SMTP mail server.
